Just wishing you all a beautiful life! \r\nI am a travel junkie, photography enthusiast, an avid book reader, a computer scientist and the beach bum who can't swim. I am a web designer and developer with interest in programming languages, web and mobile applications. I have a double degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I enjoy getting my hands busy with hardware and software stuff. I would like to document my programming projects in this page. Watch out for me in the next days! \r\n\r\nCode my life, \r\n\r\n**Gracie**\r\nwww.gracesojor.com\r\ngrace[dot]sojor[at]gmail.com\r\nManila, Philippines\r\n![*Gracie](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/969529?v=3&s=460)\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
